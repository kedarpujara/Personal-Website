					<p>
					Hey there! I'm Kedar, just a 21 year old boy trying to carve his path in life. I'm set to graduate this June with a degree in Computer Science with a Specialization in Bioinformatics from the University of California, San Diego. I've always been fascinated with computers and just find it simply amazing that computers are changing the way the world operates. I'm excited to see what the future has in store and even more excited to be able to contribute to this golden age of technology.

					<p style="padding-top: 70px;">I first touched a basketball at the age of 5 and I fell in love. I have been playing since then in various leagues, whether was for the school team, NJB, or an intramural team. I actively keep up with the NBA and I am an avid Golden State Warriors fan (raised in the bay). I love conversations and debates about basketball, its players, and its history so hit me up if you ever want to chat. Also, you will hardly ever hear me turn down a chance to play basketball so also hit me up if you're in the area and want to play some pickup. Go Dubs! #ballisife </p>

				<div class="col-lg-8">					
					<p style="padding-top: 70px">I first picked up tossing around a frisbee when a few of my friends and I would toss around during lunch at high school. We finally decided to create an Ultimate Frisbee club our senior year and got about 60 to people to join. This passion for the sport carried right over into college and I have spent the last four years as a member of the UCSD Ultimate Frisbee Club Team. My team freshman year qualified for the 2014 National Championship Tournament in Cincinnati as we were ranked 13th in the nation. I've made some great friends along the way and would love to spread my love of ultimate frisbee with the world.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-8">					
					<p style="padding-top: 70px">In the spring of 2015, my buddy mentioned a new fraternity being founded on our campus at UCSD. Initially, I was not too keen on the idea of a fraternity, especially since I had a brotherhood in the ultimate frisbee club team. But, I came to terms that this was too good of an opportunity to pass up. I could help make a real difference to how fraternities are viewed on campuses because we, as the founders, get to decide which direction to take this fraternity. Thus, I am proud to say that I helped found the California Kappa chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in May 2015 at UCSD. We are still going strong and I hold very strong ties to my brothers till this day.</p>

					<h3>Eagle Scout</h3>

				<div class="col-lg-8">					
					<p style="padding-top: 70px">I first became a cub scout at the age of 7 and became enchanted with everything about scouting: late night campfires and stories, summer camps, hiking to cool places, and helping the community. What wasn't there to love. Since then, I became a boy scout and moved up the ranks. Finally, by my senior year of high school, I was able to achieve the highest rank in scouting: Eagle Scout. For my project, I had built bleachers in the form of benches for the tennis team at my high school. Alternatively, the benches served as an area for students to wait while they waited to be picked up from school and taken home. I've gotten so much out of scouting and it feels good to be able to give back to the community. I still go hiking and camping regularly. Going forward, I strive to uphold the principles I've learned from scouting. </p>
